<p>I got up early, still benefitting from the reverse jet-lag, and had myself a donut while waiting for my compatriots.</p>

<p><strong>Now, this wasn't just any donut</strong>, it was a glazed cake donut, one of the ones with the edges that start to fan out from the center. It was delicious and moist, and tasted of all the promise of manifest destiny. It was the perfect way to start off my first Saturday away from home.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually</strong>, once everyone was up, we decided to go up to the City for the day. Plans were made, Ubers were called, and train tickets purchased. And just like that, we were riding Caltrain up to the San Francisco.</p>

<p>The ride was scenic, but long, almost unbearably long. We spent 80 minutes on the train and made more than 15 stops, it was enough time to catch up on some podcasts, but I could see how the novelty might wear off for frequent travellers.</p>

<p>But then, we were in the City, and you could tell that it was a <em>City</em>. The train deposited us close to AT&amp;T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, and just down the street from the Embarcadero, perfect pedestrian fodder.</p>

<p>Sallying forth, we walked into the Embarcadero <em>(Spanish for "wharf", lit. "the place for emabarking")</em> and along the bay. The view was magnificent, the sky clear, and the water majestic. Almost immediately, we could see the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and it was magnificent. The bridge-span struck fearlessly into the Bay, towering high above our heads, on a scale I could hardly conceive even though I call Pittsburgh, City of Bridges, my home.</p>

<p><em>This picture does not even begin to do it justice.</em></p>

<p>During our walk we saw some wonderful sculptures, the buildings owned by people I recognize (Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania) and admire (Mozilla), all framed by the wide walkway along the bay. We walked onto some of the piers, visited a bunch of little shops, and feasted our senses on all of the sights, smells, and senses.</p>

<p><em>The Gateway to the West</em></p>

<p>By this time we were not just hungry, but ravenous, so we kept walking and laughing like four happy exploring 20-somethings, but on the inside our eyes were vigilant for food like starving wolves. We made it to Pier 39, a fairly commercial, touristy attraction near the Aquarium of the Bay and Exploratorium, and instantly started scoping out our dining options, before settling on a decent Mexi-Cali restaurant, with outdoor seating overlooking the Bay. I didn't take any pictures, but there were sailboats, a view of Oakland, and even some Sea Lions, flopping around on the pier.</p>

<p>Finally satiated, we continued walking along the increasingly commercial wharf, passing Madame Toussand's, Ripley's Believe It Or Not, and the fanciest McDonald's I have ever seen. There were plenty of diamonds in the rough, but quite a lot of rough to sift through, so we turned away from the Bay and made our way inland. We stopped by Ghiradelli Square for some free chocolate, and then started walking up San Francisco's (in)famous hills. </p>

<p>From the top, we got wonderful views all the way around the city, and were insulated from the tourist traps along the waterfront. Along the way, we were greeted by Lombard Street, built on a hill so steep that the road was curved into a series of eight hairpin turns to make it easier to drive.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2014/10/20140921_000332957_iOS.jpg" alt="A View From the Top of Lombard Street"></p>

<p>After Lombard, I finally felt like we were in the city. We'd made it to the Russian Hill neighborhood, and were greeted by undulating hills, row houses, and tiny little shops on the corners. I don't have any pictures from there, it was just so peaceful that I didn't think to pull out my phone.</p>

<p>We kept walking in a straight line, through the Tenderloin, past the City Hall, and into Market Street. We stopped in the Apple Store, but were rebuffed by the mass of humanity, so continued on, passing outlets, and boutiques left and right. We continued our journey until we were too tired to walk, and finally made for the Moscone Center and one last bite to eat before catching the Caltrain back to Cupertino, exhausted, but exhilarated by a successful expedition to the big City.</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/donuts-drivers-and-the-city/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">3b1b78dd-d81b-45b2-9569-90e84e0486cd</guid><category><![CDATA[exploration]]></category><category><![CDATA[donuts]]></category><category><![CDATA[san-fran]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicholas Kachur]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to the West Coast!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The night I arrived, I was too tired to do anything. I greeted my roommates, hung out with them for a socially acceptable amount of time, and then promptly fell face first onto my new bed.</p>

<p><strong>Lights Out</strong></p>

<p>The next morning started slowly, my roommates trickled out to work, leaving me alone with a whole day to explore the area. Fortunately, my stomach quickly came up with a very thoughtful plan, so I set out to find food.</p>

<p>Our apartment complex is aptly named Cupertino City Center, and is well positioned with all the essentials in walking distance. The two main streets De Anza Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard cross less than 100 yards from the door, which are both plentifully lined with shops. Less than 15 minutes walk will bring you to a Target, Whole Foods, and "Sprouts Farmer's Market", with many smaller shops dotted in between.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2014/10/20141011_002703882_iOS.jpg" alt="Stevens Creek and De Anza | Seriously, these are BIG streets.">
<em>Seriously, these are BIG streets.</em></p>

<p>Not wanting to keep my stomach waiting, I went for the familiar option, and picked up some cereal and other provisions at Target, enjoying the crisp California air along the way. Before setting out, I noticed there was a bagel shop nearby: "Noah's New York Bagels". Fresh from the East Coast, I was eager to discover if these Westerners could boil a good bagel, so I rushed in to make an order, but was disappointed to find that it was a chain in the style of Einstein Bros. Bagels. Crestfallen, I settled for a chintzy chocolate chip bagel and an outrageously expensive orange juice before heading back to the apartment.</p>

<p>Once there, I tried to take in my surroundings. The apartment surely lives up to its "luxury" designation, with hardwood floors, granite countertops, and plenty of fancy furnishings. My bedroom (I get to share the Master), has floor-to-ceiling mirror doors on the closet and an adjoining bathroom. The kitchen came with a full-set of cookware (including kettle), and my favorite: a dishwasher!</p>

<p>Not wanting to waste my first exploration day, I left the apartment to check out the Cupertino Civic Center, just 10 minutes south of the apartment.</p>

<p>While my apartment (and adjoining buildings) are called Cupertino City Center, the City Hall, Community Center, and Public Library all reside in Cupertino Civic Center. Together, the three buildings surround a scenic plaza, and neighbor a large, open field, which was set up for cricket when I walked by.</p>

<p>I wandered through the library, impressed by their large collection and thoughtful presentation, and resolved to come back and acquire a library card as soon as possible.</p>

<p>By the time I was done, kids were starting to stream down the streets on bicycles and in packs, school seemed to be letting out for the day. Curious, I backtracked their trail, quickly losing myself in residential suburbia. Eventually, I found a nearby elementary and middle school, complete with crossing guard and all. Not wanting to be a creepy 20-something on an elementary school campus, I pressed on, and lazily meandered back in the general direction of City Center.</p>

<p>By now, I was fairly tired of walking, so I took some more time to settle in and relax back at the apartment, waiting for my roommates to get done with work. Once they got home, we went out for dinner at a restaurant called BJ's, a fairly large place for somewhat fancy pub food, right outside of Apple's main campus. It was a quick 15 minute walk, and the food was acceptable. Fried Calimari for the table that had a nice crisp and wasn't too rubbery, with plenteous portions on our burgers and ribs.</p>

<p>After almost lapsing into food coma, we made our way back, and were greeted by the warm, fuzzy neon sign of Donut Wheel, a somewhat sketchy, but entirely delicious 24-hour, cash-only Donut Shop. Perfect pickings for 3 college interns late on a Friday night. A nice family with a small child helped us learn the etiquette, and we returned home with a half-dozen donuts, ready a fun-filled Saturday morning.</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/welcome-to-the-west-coast/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cf6318bc-0dc4-41e0-85a4-e8e870d55cf5</guid><category><![CDATA[beginnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[exploration]]></category><category><![CDATA[food]]></category><category><![CDATA[apartment]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicholas Kachur]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2014 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
