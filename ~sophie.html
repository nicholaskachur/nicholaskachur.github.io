        <h3>Cover of You Were Cool by the Mountain Goats</h3>

        <p>You Were Cool is an unreleased song by the Mountain Goats,
            that I didn't discover until several years as a fan. When
            thinking of songs to play for people, this one was a clear
            favorite for you. I don't know how hard high school was for
            you&mdash;you always sounded encircled by friends&mdash;but
            I think the sentiment is a bit universal.

            meantime, you can see John Darnielle play it live at 
            <a href=https://youtu.be/JYeeQn65qPw>Carnegie Hall</a>
            and <a herf=https://youtu.be/A3n_RKEuRlw>the 2013 Newport
