<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
My Kachur (paternal) and Hitz (maternal) family trees have some solid
culinary skills. Both sides have been known to make tasty food, from
Thanksgiving turkey to Christmas cookies and family dinners to road
trip lunches. I've long dreamt of collecting some of the recipes and
knowledge into one place, so here's my latest attempt at that.

<p>
Risotto is a creamy rice dish that can be served as a main or as a
complement to another dish. I learned to make it as part of a
community education culinary course from Walnut Hill College here in
Philly, and it's become a go-to ever since.
</p>

<p>
Risotto can be a little finicky when you're getting started, but is
pretty simple once you've gotten the hang of it. The basic gist is
that you will sauté some vegetables or other accoutrements, toast your
rice in the same pan, and then add mostly chicken broth with a helping 
of white wine a little at a time to cook the rice.
</p>

<p>
You add the liquid a little at a time because you need a lot of it to
cook the rice and there's only so much room in the pan. You need to
prevent the rice from burning to the bottom by stirring it around and
keeping it moist, but you can leave it unattended for a few minutes at
a time as long as there's enough liquid.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Stir the risotto to get a better sense of how wet it is. Looks can be
deceiving when the risotto has been sitting still. You want to serve
it a little moist but not soggy.
</p>

<p>
I've found I can fit a risotto for 1/2 cup of rice in an 8-inch
skillet, 1 cup in a 10-inch, and 2 cups in a 12-inch.
</p>

<p>
Risotto does not hold or reheat too well, so it's best to eat it fresh
and promptly.
</p>


<h3 id="risotto-recipe">Risotto Recipe</h3>

<p>
This recipe is a <em>base</em> recipe, you can adjust the proportions
according to need and experiment with other ingredients. I enjoy
sautéing sliced mushrooms with the onion to make a mushroom risotto
and/or adding diced tomatoes with the garlic. You can even use beef
stock and red wine, if you want.

<h4>Fast Facts</h4>

    <li>1 cup Carnaroli, Arborio, or Sushi rice, or another that's starchy and
        short-to-medium grain</li>
    <li>5 cups stock (typically chicken)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white wine (optional, replaces an equivalent amount of stock)</li>
    <li>1 ounce butter or olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion (e.g., yellow or Spanish), minced</li>
    <li>4 to 6 cloves garlic, sliced or minced</li>
