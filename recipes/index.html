<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
My Kachur (paternal) and Hitz (maternal) family trees have some solid
culinary skills. Both sides have been known to make tasty food, from
Thanksgiving turkey to Christmas cookies and family dinners to road
trip lunches. I've long dreamt of collecting some of the recipes and
knowledge into one place, so here's my latest attempt at that.

<h2 id="risotto">Risotto</h2>

<p><em><a href="#risotto-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Risotto is a creamy rice dish that can be served as a main or as a
complement to another dish. I learned to make it as part of a
community education culinary course from Walnut Hill College here in
Philly, and it's become a go-to ever since.
</p>

<p>
Risotto can be a little finicky when you're getting started, but is
pretty simple once you've gotten the hang of it. The basic gist is
that you will sauté some vegetables or other accoutrements, toast your
rice in the same pan, and then add mostly chicken broth with a helping 
of white wine a little at a time to cook the rice.
</p>

<p>
You add the liquid a little at a time because you need a lot of it to
cook the rice and there's only so much room in the pan. You need to
prevent the rice from burning to the bottom by stirring it around and
keeping it moist, but you can leave it unattended for a few minutes at
a time as long as there's enough liquid.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Stir the risotto to get a better sense of how wet it is. Looks can be
deceiving when the risotto has been sitting still. You want to serve
it a little moist but not soggy.
</p>

<p>
I've found I can fit a risotto for 1/2 cup of rice in an 8-inch
skillet, 1 cup in a 10-inch, and 2 cups in a 12-inch.
</p>

<p>
Risotto does not hold or reheat too well, so it's best to eat it fresh
and promptly.
</p>


<h3 id="risotto-recipe">Risotto Recipe</h3>

<p>
This recipe is a <em>base</em> recipe, you can adjust the proportions
according to need and experiment with other ingredients. I enjoy
sautéing sliced mushrooms with the onion to make a mushroom risotto
and/or adding diced tomatoes with the garlic. You can even use beef
stock and red wine, if you want.
</p>

<h2 id="goulash">Goulash</h2>

<p><em><a href="#goulash-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Goulash is a traditional Hungarian stew made with beef and paprika
that'll stick to your ribs on a cold night. It does take a little
planning to work around the long simmer time, but is well worth it,
and doesn't need too much attention during that period. Serve with
Grandma K-style mashed potatoes and a hearty vegetable for a meal that
will leave everyone satisfied.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
During the long simmer period, the stew has a tendency to burn to the
bottom. You can prevent this by lowering the heat and stirring the pot
occasionally. Try to keep the stew on a low heat just below the point
at which you notice any substantial surface activity. It's okay if
some of the stew burns to the bottom, you'll just have less of it come
dinnertime and a tough pot-cleaning job ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
Goulash reheats well, so if you don't have time to cook for four hours
right before dinnertime, you can make it ahead of time then reheat it
in ten minutes or so over low heat on the stovetop (just don't burn it!).
</p>

<p>
When choosing meat to use, many grocery stores offer a pre-cubed
stewing beef that is completely serviceable. If you want to use a
slightly more upscale beef, you could consider any of the following
cuts that I found by just searching the web for suggestions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chuck</li>
    <li>Tri-tip</li>
    <li>Top Sirloin</li>
    <li>Brisket</li>
    <li>Shank</li>
    <li>Short rib</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="goulash-recipe">Goulash Recipe</h3>

<h4>Fast Facts</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Yield: 4 to 6 servings, depending how hungry you are</li>
    <li>Prep time: approximately 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Cook time: approximately 3 to 4 hours</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>About 2 lbs. stewing beef, cut into approximately 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 yellow or white onions, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine, an inexpensive blend is fine</li>
    <li>1/2 cup beef broth, e.g., made using boullion</li>
    <li>6 ounces (1 small can) tomato paste</li>
    <li>Paprika to taste, at least a tablespoon</li>
    <li>Cayenne pepper to taste, start with a teaspoon</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Cooking oil for frying, like an extra virgin or light olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Dredge the beef chunks in flour seasoned with salt and pepper
        until lightly coated. <em>Pro-tip: you can use a plastic zip
        bag and just shake everything together in it.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fry the chopped onions in a lightly oiled stock pot until
        transluscent, then remove from the pot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sear the beef in the stock pot, adding a little more oil if
        necessary. You may need to sear the beef in multiple batches.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine the wine, broth, tomato paste, onions, and beef in the
        stock pot. Mix well. Season with the paprika, cayenne pepper,
        salt, and pepper. <em>Remember, you can never remove
        seasonings once you've added them.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Gently simmer on low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 hours until
        beef is tender. Taste the liquid occasionally and carefully
        add more of the seasonings as desired.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve to raucous applause, or chill and refrigerate to be
        reheated another time.
    </li>

<h2 id="paprikas">Chicken Paprikas</h2>

<p><em><a href="#paprikas-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Chicken Paprikas (pronounced <em>Paprikash</em>) is another traditional
Hungarian dish, a delectable chicken in paprika-infused sauce. It was
a go-to for Grandma Kachur, and I remember having it with her many
delicious times.
</p>

<p>
I haven't made this recently, so the following recipe is a hybrid of
what I do remember and a recipe I've linked to in the
<a href="#paprikas-alternates">alternate recipes section</a>. Please
feel free to experiment with it and propose improvements.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Paprika that is too old will smell and taste dull and not season the
dish adequately. Prefer to use fresher paprika if at all possible.
<p>

<p>
You can use chicken breast or chicken thighs, or even whatever parts
of a whole chicken you have around depending on your preferences. Some
people really like bone-in, skin-on meat for this dish, others (like
me) prefer boneless. Grandma Kachur seemed to use chicken thighs, mostly.
</p>

<p>
It's best to let the dish cool a little before adding the sour cream,
that way it doesn't curdle on you.
</p>

        Chicken Paprikash from Simply Recipes
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>About 2 lbs. chicken, optionally cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 2 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
    <li>2 to 3 medium yellow onions, sliced into half or quarter-moons</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth, e.g., made from boullion</li>
    <li>1/2 to 1 cup sour cream, to taste</li>
    <li>About 3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Lightly salt the chicken and let sit at room temperature for
        about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Melt about 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a large
        saucepan, then brown the chicken thoroughly, about 5 to 10
        minutes. Remove the chicken from the saucepan to a bowl or
        plate and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the onions to the saucepan and cook them until softened,
        about 10 minutes. You can add a little more butter if you need
        more liquid, and if you have any crusty chicken residue on the
        bottom of the pan (called <em>fond</em>), scrape up that
        goodness to incorporate it into the onions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the chicken stock to the saucepan with the onions, and
        return the chicken to that pan as well. Bring to a bare simmer,
        which will probably require medium-low or low heat.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a separate, small skillet, create a roux with the flour and
        remaining 1 tablespoon butter. That is, melt the butter over
        low heat then add the flour and mix until a paste forms. Add
        the paprika and toast for no more than 30 seconds, being
        careful not to burn it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the roux-paprika mixture to the chicken-onion-stock pan,
        and mix to combine. Let the full mixture simmer for about 30
        to 45 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and chicken is
        cooked through (safe internal temperature: ≥165℉). Season
        cautiously with additional paprika, salt, and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the mixture cool briefly, then mix in the sour cream to
        thicken it up. Serve over a starch like mashed potatoes, egg
        noodles, or spaetzle.
    </li>
    <li>Bask in the ensuing adulation.</li>

<h2 id="mashed-potatoes">Grandma K's Mashed Potatoes</h2>

<p><em><a href="#mashed-potatoes-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Grandma K's Mashed Potatoes are not so much a recipe as a philosophy:
"if you're going to have mashed potatoes, why not have them as creamy
as you can?" To that end, this isn't so much "Grandma K's Recipe," as
the one thing I know she did that I really like.
</p>

<p>
Sour cream. She used sour cream. Apply that to any mashed potato
recipe as you see fit. I will provide a very basic recipe here, but
they're mashed potatoes—you can probably figure it out.
</p>


<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Apparently, Yukon Gold Potatoes are especially good for mashing, but
your basic Russet Potato will do just fine too.
</p>

<p>
There are people on the internet who offer really good mashed potato
recipes, but I don't know that any of them are <em>that</em> much
better than your basic "mix things together" recipe.
</p>

<p>
I always leave the skins on because I am recovering from a childhood
where I hated potato skins (don't ask me why, I don't remember), but
you do you. Peel 'em if you want, it's up to you.
</p>

    <li>Cook time: approximately 1 hour</li>

<h4 id="mashed-potatoes-alternates">Alternate Recipes</h4>
<p>
If you really want the best mashed potatoes you can get, try
the excellent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIibuibsy_U">
J. Kenji Lopez Alt's recipe</a>,
which does not seem like <em>that</em> much more work. (But is
it really worth the extra effort? I don't know.)
</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>4 to 6 medium size potatoes, cut into 1 or 2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 1 cup sour cream, to taste</li>
    <li>About 4 tablespoons (half a stick) butter</li>
    <li>About 1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Fill a large stockpot with water and salt it substantially.
        Add the potatoes while the water is still cool, and you won't
        risk burning yourself, yay! Bring the water to a rolling boil,
        and cook the potatoes for another 20 to 30 minutes. You'll
        know they're ready when a fork or knife pierces them easily.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drain the potatoes. Before returning them to the stockpot, add
        the butter to it and melt it under low heat. <em>Then,</em>
        you can add the potatoes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now comes the tricky part: add milk, sour cream, salt, and
        pepper a little at a time while you start to mash the potatoes.
        Taste them as you go and adjust until you're content.
    </li>
    <li>
        You did it! You made mashed potatoes. Grandma K would be proud.
    </li>

<h2 id="chocolate-chip-cookies">Mom's Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>

<p><em><a href="#chocolate-chip-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Mom's chocolate chip cookie recipe is based on the venerable Toll
House recipe with some tweaks for our family's preferences. Using
shortening and an extra quarter-cup of flour makes them fluffier, and
the handful of chocolate chunks adds a little more variety to the
chocolate experience.
</p>

<p>
This recipe uses ingredients that you can reasonably keep on hand most
times of the year, so it makes an excellent companion for quickly
satisfying baked good urges.
</p>


<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
While most of these ingredients are easy to keep on hand, my old
roommate Aaron introduced me to the wonder of keeping a box of brownie
mix on hand. That has even fewer required ingredients (usually just
oil and an egg), and is even easier to put together on a whim. Thanks
Aaron!
</p>

<p>
If you don't have an electric mixer, I've used the trick of melting the
butter in a saucepan to make it easier to work with. You would need to
ensure the mixture isn't too hot before adding your eggs so they don't
scramble.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to bake these right after making the dough. It may
even be better to chill them in the refrigerator or freezer, after
which they form easier for baking.
</p>

<p>
The dough can be kept covered in the fridge for several days, or in
the freezer for about a month, if you don't want to bake them all at
once.
