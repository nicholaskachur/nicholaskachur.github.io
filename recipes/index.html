<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
My Kachur (paternal) and Hitz (maternal) family trees have some solid
culinary skills. Both sides have been known to make tasty food, from
Thanksgiving turkey to Christmas cookies and family dinners to road
trip lunches. I've long dreamt of collecting some of the recipes and
knowledge into one place, so here's my latest attempt at that.

<h2 id="risotto">Risotto</h2>

<p><em><a href="#risotto-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Risotto is a creamy rice dish that can be served as a main or as a
complement to another dish. I learned to make it as part of a
community education culinary course from Walnut Hill College here in
Philly, and it's become a go-to ever since.
</p>

<p>
Risotto can be a little finicky when you're getting started, but is
pretty simple once you've gotten the hang of it. The basic gist is
that you will saut√© some vegetables or other accoutrements, toast your
rice in the same pan, and then add mostly chicken broth with a helping 
of white wine a little at a time to cook the rice.
</p>

<p>
You add the liquid a little at a time because you need a lot of it to
cook the rice and there's only so much room in the pan. You need to
prevent the rice from burning to the bottom by stirring it around and
keeping it moist, but you can leave it unattended for a few minutes at
a time as long as there's enough liquid.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Stir the risotto to get a better sense of how wet it is. Looks can be
deceiving when the risotto has been sitting still. You want to serve
it a little moist but not soggy.
</p>

<p>
I've found I can fit a risotto for 1/2 cup of rice in an 8-inch
skillet, 1 cup in a 10-inch, and 2 cups in a 12-inch.
</p>

<p>
Risotto does not hold or reheat too well, so it's best to eat it fresh
and promptly.
</p>

<p>
This recipe is a <em>base</em> recipe, you can adjust the proportions
according to need and experiment with other ingredients. I enjoy
saut√©ing sliced mushrooms with the onion to make a mushroom risotto
and/or adding diced tomatoes with the garlic. You can even use beef
stock and red wine, if you want.

<h2 id="goulash">Goulash</h2>

<p><em><a href="#goulash-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Goulash is a traditional Hungarian stew made with beef and paprika
that'll stick to your ribs on a cold night. It does take a little
planning to work around the long simmer time, but is well worth it,
and doesn't need too much attention during that period. Serve with
Grandma K-style mashed potatoes and a hearty vegetable for a meal that
will leave everyone satisfied.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
During the long simmer period, the stew has a tendency to burn to the
bottom. You can prevent this by lowering the heat and stirring the pot
occasionally. Try to keep the stew on a low heat just below the point
at which you notice any substantial surface activity. It's okay if
some of the stew burns to the bottom, you'll just have less of it come
dinnertime and a tough pot-cleaning job ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
Goulash reheats well, so if you don't have time to cook for four hours
right before dinnertime, you can make it ahead of time then reheat it
in ten minutes or so on the stovetop (just don't burn it!).
</p>

<p>
When choosing meat to use, many grocery stores offer a pre-cubed
stewing beef that is completely serviceable. If you want to use a
slightly more upscale beef, you could consider any of the following
cuts that I found by just searching the web for suggestions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chuck</li>
    <li>Tri-tip</li>
    <li>Top Sirloin</li>
    <li>Brisket</li>
    <li>Shank</li>
    <li>Short rib</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fast Facts</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Yield: 4 to 6 servings, depending how hungry you are</li>
    <li>Prep time: approximately 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Cook time: approximately 3 to 4 hours</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>About 2 lbs. stewing beef, cut into approximately 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 yellow or white onions, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine, an inexpensive blend is fine</li>
    <li>1/2 cup beef broth, e.g., made using boullion</li>
    <li>6 ounces (1 small can) tomato paste</li>
    <li>Paprika to taste, at least a tablespoon</li>
    <li>Cayenne pepper to taste, start with a teaspoon</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Cooking oil for frying, like an extra virgin or light olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Dredge the beef chunks in flour seasoned with salt and pepper
        until lightly coated. <em>Pro-tip: you can use a plastic zip
        bag and just shake everything together in it.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fry the chopped onions in a lightly oiled stock pot until
        transluscent, then remove from the pot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sear the beef in the stock pot, adding a little more oil if
        necessary. You may need to sear the beef in multiple batches.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine the wine, broth, tomato paste, onions, and beef in the
        stock pot. Mix well. Season with the paprika, cayenne pepper,
        salt, and pepper. <em>Remember, you can never remove
        seasonings once you've added them.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Gently simmer on low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 hours until
        beef is tender. Taste the liquid occasionally and carefully
        add more of the seasonings as desired.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve to raucous applause, or chill and refrigerate to be
        re-heated another time.
    </li>
</ol>
