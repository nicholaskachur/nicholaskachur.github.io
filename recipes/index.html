<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
My Kachur (paternal) and Hitz (maternal) family trees have some solid
culinary skills. Both sides have been known to make tasty food, from
Thanksgiving turkey to Christmas cookies and family dinners to road
trip lunches. I&rsquo;ve long dreamt of collecting some of the recipes
and knowledge into one place, so here&rsquo;s my latest attempt at that.

<h2 id="pancakes">Pancakes</h2>

<p>
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with making pancakes using a box mix, but
a good scratch recipe can give your morning a sense of delicious
accomplishment. I like
<a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/05/tall-fluffy-buttermilk-pancakes/">
this one from Smitten Kitchen</a>, which makes a delicious stack
while respecting the sanctity of a laid-back weekend morning.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
If you don&rsquo;t have buttermilk, there are a number of ways to make
an approximation using other ingredients. My favorite such trick comes
from J. Kenji López-Alt: mix equal parts regular milk and sour cream
to make the desired amount of buttermilk substitute. Buttermilk itself
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-long-does-buttermilk-last#bottom-line">
keeps for about two weeks after opening</a>, so you may decide
it&rsquo;s okay to keep some on hand.
</p>

<p>
Go wild with the toppings! Macerate some sliced strawberries by
sprinkling a tablespoon or two of sugar over them and letting them sit
for a few minutes. Pick up a fancy jam or apple butter from the
farmer&rsquo;s market. Even spring for maple syrup&mdash;you&rsquo;re
worth it.
</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="yogurt">Yogurt Ideas</h2>

<p>
Plain Greek Yogurt is a wonderful thing. It's a blank canvas upon
which you can build a wide variety of healthy breakfasts. I don't eat
it too often, so I spring for the richer, full-fat versions and skip
the non-fat ones. Here are some ideas for mixins that might make your
day.
</p>

<p><em>
For a more even consistency, mix finer ingredients like syrups and
sugar into the yogurt first before chunkier ingredients like granola.
</em></p>

<h3>Breakfast Yogurt Mixins</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Liquid sweeteners like agave, simple, or maple syrup.</li>
    <li>Solid sweeteners like granulated, turbinado, or brown sugar.</li>
    <li>Fruit jams, preserves, or marmalades.</li>
    <li>Apple butter.</li>
    <li>
        Whole or sliced fruits. You can macerate them with sugar if
        you're really feeling a sweet tooth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Homemade or store-bought granolas. Though many store-bought
        versions use nuts of some kind, there are some that don't.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risotto">Risotto</h2>

<p><em><a href="#risotto-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Risotto is a creamy rice dish that can be served as a main or as a
complement to another dish. I learned to make it as part of a
community education culinary course from Walnut Hill College here in
Philly, and it&rsquo;s become a go-to ever since.
</p>

<p>
Risotto can be a little finicky when you&rsquo;re getting started, but
is pretty simple once you&rsquo;ve gotten the hang of it. The basic
gist is that you will sauté some vegetables or other accoutrements,
toast your rice in the same pan, and then add mostly chicken broth
with a helping  of white wine a little at a time to cook the rice.
</p>

<p>
You add the liquid a little at a time because you need a lot of it to
cook the rice and there&rsquo;s only so much room in the pan. You need
to prevent the rice from burning to the bottom by stirring it around
and keeping it moist, but you can leave it unattended for a few
minutes at a time as long as there&rsquo;s enough liquid.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Stir the risotto to get a better sense of how wet it is. Looks can be
deceiving when the risotto has been sitting still. You want to serve
it a little moist but not soggy.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve found I can fit a risotto for 1/2 cup of rice in an 8-inch
skillet, 1 cup in a 10-inch, and 2 cups in a 12-inch.
</p>

<p>
Risotto does not hold or reheat too well, so it&rsquo;s best to eat it
fresh and promptly.
</p>


<h3 id="risotto-recipe">Risotto Recipe</h3>

<p>
This recipe is a <em>base</em> recipe, you can adjust the proportions
according to need and experiment with other ingredients. I enjoy
sautéing sliced mushrooms with the onion to make a mushroom risotto
and/or adding diced tomatoes with the garlic. You can even use beef
stock and red wine, if you want.
</p>

<h2 id="alfredo">Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>

<p><em><a href="#alfredo-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
When Dad was a young man, he worked in various restaurants, including
a classy Italian restaurant called Scordado&rsquo;s. Even though he
was a waiter there, he got in on the cooking action by preparing some
dishes tableside, one of which was Fettuccine Alfredo.
</p>

<p>
Now, Fettuccine Alfredo is everything I love in a food: butter, cheese,
and some kind of starch to deliver it to my mouth. It was always
special when Dad would make Alfredo for us, and one day he decided it
was time to pass it down to me.
</p>

<p>
The recipe is not complicated&mdash;it needed to be easily prepared
tableside&mdash;but it does its job capably. Even as a high schooler,
I was able to put it together, and it became my go-to dish for a
while, whenever I needed something a little &ldquo;fancy.&rdquo; Now,
I&rsquo;m a little more restrained, but it&rsquo;s still fun to bust
out every now and then.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
For a dish as simple as this, quality ingredients make a big
difference. You&rsquo;ll certainly want quality grated cheese, the
green canister is not a great choice here. Additionally, slow-dried
bronze-die or bronze-drawn pasta will give you more texture for the
sauce to adhere to, and fresh pasta is also a good choice if you can
find it. If you have access to a good specialty shop (such as
Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in the Strip District), that would be a
good place to find these things. However, I&rsquo;ve found bronze-die
pasta in my local grocery store and Trader Joe&rsquo;s has good enough
cheese.
</p>

<p>
To make a meal around this, you might consider adding a baguette with
some butter or an oil-and-herb mixture along with some kind of salad.
You want to keep the rest of the meal light, since the Alfredo is so
dense. You can also add some kind of protein or vegetable to the
pasta. Grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, and cut up roasted
asparagus all work. Whatever you add, you would typically add it to
the pasta once you&rsquo;ve finished making the sauce.
</p>

<p>
Alfredo doesn&rsquo;t reheat all that well, but if you add a little
cream or milk after microwaving it, you may be able to improve the
results just a little.
</p>

<h3 id="alfredo-recipe">Fettuccine Alfredo Recipe</h3>

<h4>Fast Facts</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Yield: 4 to 6 servings, depending how hungry you are</li>
    <li>Prep time: approximately 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Cook time: approximately 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound fettucine or another long-and-wide pasta</li>
    <li>1 pound grated parmesan, romano, or a blend of the two</li>
    <li>1 pint heavy cream, half-and-half, or (less ideally) whole milk</li>
    <li>1 stick butter</li>
    <li>Salt for the pasta water</li>
    <li>Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Optional protein or vegetable to add to the dish</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Fill a stockpot with water, salt the water thoroughly, and
        bring to a boil.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are preparing any additional protein or vegetable, now
        would be the time to get that ready, then keep it warm until
        it&rsquo;s time to add to the pasta.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook the pasta according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions.
        Once cooked, reserve about a half-cup to a cup of the pasta
        water in a heatproof vessel. Drain the pasta and leave it in
        the colander. Add the butter to the stockpot over very low
        heat to melt it. Once melted, return the pasta to the pot and
        mix to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add cream and cheese a little at a time, keeping the heat on
        very low. Mix and taste in between additions. In the
        beginning, start by adding about a half cup of each at a time,
        then alternate adding cream and cheese until satisfied with
        the flavor and texture. It should be cheesy and full, but a
        little loose as the sauce will set slightly when removed from
        heat. You likely won&rsquo;t need to use all the cream and
        cheese, and you can use some of the reserved pasta water to
        help the cheese emulsify into the sauce. Season with black
        pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are adding anything else to the pasta, do so now, and
        mix to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure to turn the burner off, then serve to glorious
        adulation.

<h2 id="goulash">Goulash</h2>

<p><em><a href="#goulash-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Goulash is a traditional Hungarian stew made with beef and paprika
that&rsquo;ll stick to your ribs on a cold night. It does take a
little planning to work around the long simmer time, but is well worth
it, and doesn&rsquo;t need too much attention during that period.
Serve with Grandma K-style mashed potatoes and a hearty vegetable for
a meal that will leave everyone satisfied.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
During the long simmer period, the stew has a tendency to burn to the
bottom. You can prevent this by lowering the heat and stirring the pot
occasionally. Try to keep the stew on a low heat just below the point
at which you notice any substantial surface activity. It&rsquo;s okay
if some of the stew burns to the bottom, you&rsquo;ll just have less
of it come dinnertime and a tough pot-cleaning job ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
Goulash reheats well, so if you don&rsquo;t have time to cook for four
hours right before dinnertime, you can make it ahead of time then
reheat it in ten minutes or so over low heat on the stovetop (just
don&rsquo;t burn it!).
</p>

<p>
When choosing meat to use, many grocery stores offer a pre-cubed
stewing beef that is completely serviceable. If you want to use a
slightly more upscale beef, you could consider any of the following
cuts that I found by just searching the web for suggestions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chuck</li>
    <li>Tri-tip</li>
    <li>Top Sirloin</li>
    <li>Brisket</li>
    <li>Shank</li>
    <li>Short rib</li>
</ul>

    <li>Yield: 4 to 6 servings, depending how hungry you are</li>
    <li>Prep time: approximately 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Cook time: approximately 3 to 4 hours</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>About 2 lbs. stewing beef, cut into approximately 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 yellow or white onions, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine, an inexpensive blend is fine</li>
    <li>1/2 cup beef broth, e.g., made using boullion</li>
    <li>6 ounces (1 small can) tomato paste</li>
    <li>Paprika to taste, at least a tablespoon</li>
    <li>Cayenne pepper to taste, start with a teaspoon</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Cooking oil for frying, like an extra virgin or light olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Dredge the beef chunks in flour seasoned with salt and pepper
        until lightly coated. <em>Pro-tip: you can use a plastic zip
        bag and just shake everything together in it.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fry the chopped onions in a lightly oiled stock pot until
        transluscent, then remove from the pot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sear the beef in the stock pot, adding a little more oil if
        necessary. You may need to sear the beef in multiple batches.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combine the wine, broth, tomato paste, onions, and beef in the
        stock pot. Mix well. Season with the paprika, cayenne pepper,
        salt, and pepper. <em>Remember, you can never remove
        seasonings once you&rsquo;ve added them.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Gently simmer on low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 hours until
        beef is tender. Taste the liquid occasionally and carefully
        add more of the seasonings as desired.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve to raucous applause, or chill and refrigerate to be
        reheated another time.

<h2 id="paprikas">Chicken Paprikas</h2>

<p><em><a href="#paprikas-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Chicken Paprikas (pronounced <em>Paprikash</em>) is another traditional
Hungarian dish, a delectable chicken in paprika-infused sauce. It was
a go-to for Grandma Kachur, and I remember having it with her many
delicious times.
</p>

<p>
I haven&rsquo;t made this recently, so the following recipe is a
hybrid of what I do remember and a recipe I&rsquo;ve linked to in the
<a href="#paprikas-alternates">alternate recipes section</a>. Please
feel free to experiment with it and propose improvements.
</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Paprika that is too old will smell and taste dull and not season the
dish adequately. Prefer to use fresher paprika if at all possible.
<p>

<p>
You can use chicken breast or chicken thighs, or even whatever parts
of a whole chicken you have around depending on your preferences. Some
people really like bone-in, skin-on meat for this dish, others (like
me) prefer boneless. Grandma Kachur seemed to use chicken thighs, mostly.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s best to let the dish cool a little before adding the sour
cream, that way it doesn&rsquo;t curdle on you.
</p>

    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>About 2 lbs. chicken, optionally cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 2 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
    <li>2 to 3 medium yellow onions, sliced into half or quarter-moons</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth, e.g., made from boullion</li>
    <li>1/2 to 1 cup sour cream, to taste</li>
    <li>About 3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Lightly salt the chicken and let sit at room temperature for
        about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Melt about 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a large
        saucepan, then brown the chicken thoroughly, about 5 to 10
        minutes. Remove the chicken from the saucepan to a bowl or
        plate and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the onions to the saucepan and cook them until softened,
        about 10 minutes. You can add a little more butter if you need
        more liquid, and if you have any crusty chicken residue on the
        bottom of the pan (called <em>fond</em>), scrape up that
        goodness to incorporate it into the onions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the chicken stock to the saucepan with the onions, and
        return the chicken to that pan as well. Bring to a bare simmer,
        which will probably require medium-low or low heat.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a separate, small skillet, create a roux with the flour and
        remaining 1 tablespoon butter. That is, melt the butter over
        low heat then add the flour and mix until a paste forms. Add
        the paprika and toast for no more than 30 seconds, being
        careful not to burn it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the roux-paprika mixture to the chicken-onion-stock pan,
        and mix to combine. Let the full mixture simmer for about 30
        to 45 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and chicken is
        cooked through (safe internal temperature: ≥165&deg;F). Season
        cautiously with additional paprika, salt, and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the mixture cool briefly, then mix in the sour cream to
        thicken it up. Serve over a starch like mashed potatoes, egg
        noodles, or spaetzle.
    </li>
    <li>Bask in the ensuing adulation.</li>

<p><em><a href="#mashed-potatoes-recipe">Go directly to the recipe.</a></em></p>

<p>
Grandma K&rsquo;s Mashed Potatoes are not so much a recipe as a
philosophy: &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to have mashed potatoes, why
not have them as creamy as you can?&rdquo; To that end, this
isn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;Grandma K&rsquo;s Recipe,&rdquo; as the one
thing I know she did that I really like.
</p>

<p>
Sour cream. She used sour cream. Apply that to any mashed potato
recipe as you see fit. I will provide a very basic recipe here, but
they&rsquo;re mashed potatoes—you can probably figure it out.
</p>


<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
Apparently, Yukon Gold Potatoes are especially good for mashing, but
your basic Russet Potato will do just fine too.
</p>

<p>
There are people on the internet who offer really good mashed potato
recipes, but I don&rsquo;t know that any of them are <em>that</em>
much better than your basic &ldquo;mix things together&rdquo; recipe.
</p>

<p>
I always leave the skins on because I am recovering from a childhood
where I hated potato skins (don&rsquo;t ask me why, I don&rsquo;t
remember), but you do you. Peel &lsquo;em if you want, it&rsquo;s up
to you.

If you really want the best mashed potatoes you can get, try
the excellent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIibuibsy_U">
J. Kenji López-Alt&rsquo;s recipe</a>,
which does not seem like <em>that</em> much more work. (But is
it really worth the extra effort? I don&rsquo;t know.)
</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>4 to 6 medium size potatoes, cut into 1 or 2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>About 1 cup sour cream, to taste</li>
    <li>About 4 tablespoons (half a stick) butter</li>
    <li>About 1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Fill a large stockpot with water and salt it substantially.
        Add the potatoes while the water is still cool, and you
        won&rsquo;t risk burning yourself, yay! Bring the water to a
        rolling boil, and cook the potatoes for another 20 to 30
        minutes. You&rsquo;ll know they&rsquo;re ready when a fork or
        knife pierces them easily.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drain the potatoes. Before returning them to the stockpot, add
        the butter to it and melt it under low heat. <em>Then,</em>
        you can add the potatoes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now comes the tricky part: add milk, sour cream, salt, and
        pepper a little at a time while you start to mash the potatoes.
        Taste them as you go and adjust until you&rsquo;re content.
    </li>
    <li>
        You did it! You made mashed potatoes. Grandma K would be proud.

This recipe uses ingredients that you can reasonably keep on hand most
times of the year, so it makes an excellent companion for quickly
satisfying baked good urges.
</p>


<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>
While most of these ingredients are easy to keep on hand, my old
roommate Aaron introduced me to the wonder of keeping a box of brownie
mix on hand. That has even fewer required ingredients (usually just
oil and an egg), and is even easier to put together on a whim. Thanks
Aaron!
</p>

<p>
If you don&rsquo;t have an electric mixer, I&rsquo;ve used the trick
of melting the butter in a saucepan to make it easier to work with.
You would need to ensure the mixture isn&rsquo;t too hot before adding
your eggs so they don&rsquo;t scramble.
</p>

<p>
You don&rsquo;t have to bake these right after making the dough. It may
even be better to chill them in the refrigerator or freezer, after
which they form easier for baking.
</p>

<p>
The dough can be kept covered in the fridge for several days, or in
the freezer for about a month, if you don&rsquo;t want to bake them all at
once.

Dobos Torte&mdash;from the Hungarian last name, pronounced similarly
to <em>doe-bish</em>&mdash;is a family favorite. I was introduced to
it by way of Grandma Kachur, who pulled it out for special occasions.
</p>

<p>
In her preparation, there were six, thin layers of vanilla cake with a
chocolate buttercream frosting that is just sublime. Additionally, the
top layer of cake is covered with a caramel topping that is poured on
and then allowed to harden.

    <li>Prep time: approximately 60 minutes</li>
    <li>Bake time: approximately 30 minutes</li>
</ul>


<h4>Chocolate Buttercream Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>12 egg yolks</li>
</ul>


<h4>Chocolate Buttercream Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Melt the chocolate in a microwave or double-boiler. Set aside
        and let cool to incorporate with the butter later.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a large bowl, cream the butter and vanilla until light and
        fluffy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a small saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, bring the sugar
        and water to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
        Cover and boil syrup gently for 5&nbsp;minutes to help wash
        down any crystals that have formed on the sides of the pan.
        Uncover and continue cooking the syrup until it reaches the
        &ldquo;thread&rdquo; stage, about 230&ndash;235&deg;F, where
        it spins a 2-inch&nbsp;thread when allowed to drip from a fork.
    </li>
    <li>
        Beating constantly, pour the hot syrup very gradually into the
        egg yolks. Be careful not to scramble the eggs by pouring too
        quickly. Do not scrape syrup from the bottom and sides of the
        pan or mixers&mdash;it&rsquo;s okay if some of the sugar is left
        behind. Beat mixture until it has the consistency of creamed
        butter. Cool completely.
    </li>
    <li>
        Beat the syrup mixture about 2 tablespoons at a time into the
        butter, until <em>just</em> blended. Gradually blend in the
        chocolate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the completed frosting in the refrigerator to chill.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Torte Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
    <li>9 eggs, separated into 9 yolks and 9 whites</li>
    <li>2/3 cups sugar</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon (a pinch) salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Torte Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
    <li>
        Prepare 6 round cake pans to bake the layers. You can buy
        disposable aluminum pans to bake more at a time, or work in
        batches with as many pans as you have. Either way, grease the
        bottoms and line with parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and 1/3&nbsp;cup of the
        sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        In another large bowl, beat the egg whites and salt until
        frothy, gradually adding the other 1/3&nbsp;cup of sugar.
        Continue beating until stiff peaks form. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Gently spread egg yolk mixture over the egg whites. Add flour,
        1/4&nbsp;cup at a time, and gently fold into the egg mixture
        until just blended.
    </li>
    <li>
        Divide the batter into equal parts and bake in the cake pans
        at 350&deg;F for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
        Remove from the oven and let sit in the pans for about
        5&nbsp;minutes, then remove from the pans, peel off parchment
        paper, and cool on racks until prepared to assemble.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Caramel Topping &amp; Assembly Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Already prepared chocolate buttercream frosting</li>
    <li>Already prepared cake layers</li>
    <li>1 cup confectioner&rsquo;s sugar</li>
</ul>

<h4>Caramel Topping &amp; Assembly Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Beat the chilled frosting until fluffy. Frost and stack four
        of the cake layers. Add the fifth layer but <em>do not
        frost</em>. Return the five layers of cake to the refrigerator,
        along with the remaining frosting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the sixth layer of cake on a sheet of parchment paper,
        substantially larger than the cake. This will collect caramel
        overflow. With a knife, make shallow indents to guide where
        the cake will be sliced for serving. These will be used when
        adding the caramel. Prepare hot water to coat your knife with
        when the caramel is ready.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook the confectioner&rsquo;s sugar in a heavy skillet over
        low heat, stirring constantly using a wooden spoon or spatula.
        Low and slow is the name of the game. Press out lumps and cook
        until a smooth, liquid caramel forms. This will happen
        very slowly, then all at once, at which point you won&rsquo;t
        have much time before it burns.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour the caramel over top of the sixth layer of cake and
        spread evenly. Let the caramel just begin to set and then cut
        the cake into slices all the way through before it hardens.
        Pull apart the slices, and let the caramel cool completely.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pull the other five layers from the refigerator and frost the
        fifth layer. Arrange the caramel-topped sixth layer on top of
        it. One potential presentation is to place a floret of
        frosting for each caramel-topped slice then lean each slice at
        an angle against the floret. Frost as desired with any
        remaining buttercream.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve at room temperature to thunderous applause and heartfelt
        appreciation.
    </li>
