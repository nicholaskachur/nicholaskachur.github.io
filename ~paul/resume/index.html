<div class="resume">
Since 2005, I have specialized in php/mysql/html/css/dom/javascript, and I string these acronyms together because I believe that any worthwhile modern website requires the use and close coordination of all of these technologies.<p />

A web page begins with php providing instructions to the server while assembling data through mysql. This results in a stream of html to the client. In order to have any interactivity on the page, the underlying code must not only yield the desired appearance but must be well constructed. Therefore valid html, compliant with w3c standards, is a must, and css is used not only for visual style but even more importantly for building a coherent document object model. Once the dom is properly built, it can respond to different viewports and javascript can make it do anything.

<div class="note">
(*What about dhtml? Already covered &ndash; dhtml is javascript manipulating the dom.)<br />

(*What about ajax? Already covered &ndash; ajax is the exercise of the XMLHttpRequest object, which is a node of the dom.)<br />

(*What about web 2.0? See above.)
</div>

Before the web, I wrote programs for ms-dos, vb for windows, as well as fonts and postscript drivers, thus developing a proven agility in getting up to speed on new technologies as the need arises.<p />

Although I am not primarily a designer, I have extensive knowledge of both photoshop and illustrator, as well as long experience with type.<p />

I generally ask clients not to ask me if something is possible &ndash; assume that I can do anything and just tell me what you want.<p />
