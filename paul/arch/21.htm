There was stil the matter of making pieces to square out the arch and transporting the rocks from Tucson to Pennsylvania. Fortunately, Mom wanted to drive east for the pilgrimage so she would have her car and be able to travel around visiting old friends and family for a month. Before flying off to Tucson, I constructed wooden carriages to hold my bases and slab and get them down the stairs unharmed, then drove them to brother Timothy's house in northwest New Jersey, about an hour from the monastery.<p />
