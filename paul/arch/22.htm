I flew to Arizona again in mid-May, which left me one week to finish the stone work before packing up the car and driving the rocks back east. I spent one day putting final touches and finishing on the voussoirs, and the rest of the time shaping rocks for columns at the outside of the arch. I barely finished those in time, and as far as the remaining interior spaces, I boxed up a variety of fancy gems to work on at the site. The only interior piece I worked on was the large piece of obsidian that Dad had found and which was the pride of his collection. Naturally, I was nervous about daring to apply hammer and chisel to this piece, and as I carved off a chunk for my use, I kept looking heavenward to see if any lightning was on the way, saying out loud, "Mom said I could!"<p />
