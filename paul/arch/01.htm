The following presentation, the story behind the construction of the monument to Fr Stephen Kachur, is meant to serve several purposes. Some people have expressed interest in and appreciation for the project, and they can find here a general account of the work and the ideas behind the arch. Others have expressed interest in accomplishing a similar work, and they can find here more specific details relating to tools, materials and methods, including practical information, such as costs in both money and time. Finally, family members may be called upon to repair or complete the monument; for instance, many years from now, it may fall to someone else to finish Mom's dates, and that person may find here typographic sepcifications, etc.<p />
