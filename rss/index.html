<p>My flight out of Pittsburgh was fine, I had time to find my gate, relax, and enjoy the lunch my Father had packed--always eager to show off his sandwich making skills.</p>

<p><em>Goodbye Pittsburgh!</em></p>

<p><strong>It was Dallas where things started to go awry.</strong></p>

<p>The flight out of Pittsburgh departed late, so we barely made it to Dallas in time to catch the connecting flight. I was fidgety throughout the whole deboarding process, but thankfully made it out with about 20 minutes until my next departure time, which was only a few gates away.</p>

<p>I rushed out of the plane, looking for gate C20. There was C18, C19, but no C20. I didn't see it, the closest thing was a sign for "Baggage Carousel C20". I was desparate at this point, so I followed the sign.</p>

<p><strong>Rookie mistake.</strong></p>

<p>Suddenly I was outside the security zone; now I was getting frantic. I ran around to the nearest security point, and couldn't even see it because the line wrapped around the corner. I snapped at my phone to check my flight details. <em>Delayed, thank goodness!</em></p>

<p>I was never so glad to have my flight delayed, but now I had to resign myself to spending most of that delay back in the security line. It was fun, let me tell you.</p>

<p><strong>Skipping ahead,</strong> I landed in San Jose around 8pm, two-and-a-half hours later than I'd planned. By now it was completely dark outside, fully nighttime. Thankfully there were plenty of taxis, and I found a full minivan to myself, my bags, and my guitar. The night air felt fresh and crisp after more than 10 hours in airports and planes, and the ride went swiftly. Now I just had to find my way home.</p>

<p>After bumbling about for more than 20 minutes, a friendly security guard pointed me towards the apartment buildings, though he didn't know which one was which. I took a stab in the dark, and guessed rightly. Up some stairs, into an elevator, and down the hall.</p>

<p><strong>I was, finally, home.</strong></p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/striking-out-west/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e70a4758-f839-4859-9a93-ee1305b834e7</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicholas Kachur]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet!</p>

<p>My name is Nicholas. I'm a BS/MS student of Computer Engineering at Drexel University. In my first two years, I've won my way up  the ranks, first as a Bookseller in the <a href="http://drexel.bncollege.com/">University Bookstore</a>, then as an entitled Desk Jockey for the <a href="http://drexel.edu/engineering/resources/current_undergrad/advising/undergraduateadvisingcenter/">Engineering Advising Center</a>, a Research Minion for our <a href="http://music.ece.drexel.edu/">MET-Lab</a>, and finally a priveleged SysAdmin for the <a href="http://www.cs.drexel.edu/cs-internal/">Computer Science Department</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a Pittsburgher, born and raised, but I now live on the West Coast as an Apple Intern. I started this blog mostly as a way to archive my travels and keep interested family and friends in the loop, but you are more than welcome to read it too!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it, and I wish you many, many Safe Travels!</p>
