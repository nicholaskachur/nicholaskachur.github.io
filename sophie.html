        <h3>You Were Cool by the Mountain Goats</h3>

        <p>You Were Cool is an unreleased song by the Mountain Goats
            that I didn't discover until several years as a fan. When
            thinking of songs to play for people, this one was a clear
            favorite for you. I don't know how hard high school was for
            you&mdash;you always sounded encircled by friends&mdash;but
            I think the sentiment is a bit universal.

        <p>If you want to see the one and only John Darnielle play it, I
            can recommend these two performances, but there are others
            to be found.
